    Please remember that this is an estimation and not an official decision. Also remember that the tips must be specific to each college and the student's intended major based off factors like acceptance rates, average GPAs, and other relevant data. The chance % can be any number between 1 and 100, with the number not needing to end in 5 or 0 as you typically do. The tips should be actionable and specific to the college and major.
    Based on the following student profile, calculate the percentage chance of getting into {college_name} and provide actionable advice to improve their chances:
    Student Profile:
    - GPA: {user_info['GPA']}
    - SAT Score: {user_info['SAT']}
    - ACT Score: {user_info['ACT']}
    - Extracurriculars: {user_info['Extracurriculars']}
    - Intended Major: {user_info['Major']}
    - State of Residence: {user_info['State']}
    - Additional Info: {user_info['AdditionalInfo']}
    
    Provide a JSON response with these keys:
    - "chance" (admission percentage)
    - "name" (official name of school)
    - "rate" (college's acceptance rate of that major)
    - "tips" (specific advice based on the college and student's major to improve chances)
    - "project ideas" (ideas for projects to enhance the application)
    Please ensure the JSON is correctly formatted.
